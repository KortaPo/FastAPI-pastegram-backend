## Goals
Pastegram aims to be a new and improved pastebin, with a UI close to GitHub gists and functionality upto Instagram/Pastebin/Hastebin. It wants to provide everyone the opportunity to share pastes
as anonymous users which are kept for upto 24hours. Follow users to get their pastes in your paste feed the first. Track your paste's performance using paste analytics.

## How does it work
Pastegram allows unauthorized users to create anonymous pastes which remain for 24hours. To keep your pastes permanently, you can sign up for an account/login in if you already have one.
Pastegram uses its amazing algorithm to create your paste feed uniquely. And more features such as Tags, search, and Automatic language detection are coming very soon. Star the repo to get notified ;)
